## Early Christian Texts

This is a place for me to list links to editions of early Christian literature, in print and online. I am interested in what is available for free or a reasonable price, both for my benefit but also for the benefit of the Church. Perhaps it will help you find something. Corrections are welcome. You can [contribute directly through Github](https://github.com/Mallioch/early-christian-texts) or you can [send me a note about anything you think I should add](http://ericsowell.com/contact).

The texts are generally arranged by author and by time. If you are looking for a particular author, you can use the page search feature of your browser since everything is on this one page.

Some general notes about what you will and will not find here:

* There are scads of low-quality prints of scans of out-of-copyright books up on Amazon, and I don't plan to include those.
* I will be listing but not usually commenting on the Loeb volumes as they're a well-known set and are of generally simliar print quality.
* If there is a need for a particular work, I will list that below for each work with the marker **Needs:**. If you, like me, would like to see more of early Christian literature in print and available online, this will identify a project that someone needs to work on. Maybe that someone is you.
* If the entry begins with "P:", that means it's a link to a print edition. "E:" means electronic edition.

Here are some common sets and sites. I put notes here to avoid having to repeat myself below.

* Loeb - The Loeb volumes are widely available English and Greek/Latin diglots. The volumes are small, portable, and durable.
* Perseus - When you see this below, it refers to the Greek/English collections on the ["original" Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:Greco-Roman). This is perhaps not the best thing to call it, so I will wait for someone to give me a better one. The texts for the site, both [Greek](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit) and [Latin](https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit), are available on Github.
* Perseus Scaife - This refers to a newer site that covers similar data to the original Perseus site. [You can check it out here.](https://scaife.perseus.org/)
